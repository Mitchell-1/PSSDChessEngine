- Implement alpha-beta pruning for move generation. 
    
- Implement timing into searching so that the bot is less likely to lose on time.

- Implement the rest of the "go" commands, e.g. go wtime #### btime ####

- Implement position hashing
    - Implement transposition table for faster searching
    

Potential implementations:

- change Move object to be 64 bit data and upper 32 bits will be the moves score. Allows for sorting the move without other objects/functions.

- Implement default openings

- Implement "Capture" type feature for move generation/searching.

Done:
- Implement position hashing
    - implement 3 move repetition draw

- Update Evaluate function to include attacking in the score.

- Implement a isMoveOk function that is similar to makeMove but only checks if a move is fully legal to stop unnecessary repeated calls to makeMove. 

- Implement a counter to test how many nodes are searched/evaluated
